# ðŸ““ The companion repo to diveintoht.ml
This is a companion to [Dive Into HTML](https://diveintoht.ml), a first look into HTML, CSS, and GitHub. Check that site out, if you haven't already. (It's intended for complete beginners, and was initially planned as a meetup for [Canada Learning Code](https://canadalearningcode.ca))  

Feel free to ask any questions here, or share your finished sites. To do so, open an issue by clicking the `Issues` tab, and adding a new one. Please tag your issue either `question` or `showcase` - that way, we'll respond appropriately.
